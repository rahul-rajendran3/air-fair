# AirFair

AirFair was built to simplify the process of finding the most affordable airfare for travelers. Flexibility with travel dates and airports can lead to significant cost savings, but it can be time-consuming to manually search for these options. 

This app was developed to automate that process, making it easy for users to discover the lowest airfare tailored to their preferences and budget.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Python, and Flask.
